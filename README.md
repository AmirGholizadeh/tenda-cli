# Tenda CLI?
you may wonder what's this script supposed to do, this script is based on a specific version(tested) of tenda modem. i wanted to make a little script to add and remove MAC addresses then thought of adding more capablities to this script which has come to this. a CLI tool to manage the modem without a browser. this is most likely not going to work on your modem because well it is tested and based on a specific brand and version of modem. but this might give others an idea to how to create a CLI tool for your stuff, wether it's a tool to interact with a website on your terminal or a tool to exploit a vulnerability in a website. i intercepted all the traffic using burpsuite and then modified it to my needs and implemented it in the scripts.
